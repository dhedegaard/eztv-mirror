EZTV-Mirror

----------------------------

A simple attempt at mirroring the EZTV-site for when their servers are down. This of course relies on them still posting to the twitter channel.

The basis for this is a simple html page with some javascript to do an AJAX request to twitter and parsing the output.

After you clone the repo, simply open the .html and be amazed.

Feel free to make it work on IE6 and send a pull request :)
